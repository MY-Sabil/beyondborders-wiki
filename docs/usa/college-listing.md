# College Listing

## Colleges vs Universities

> "What is a college, am I not in a college already? Am I not applying to a university?"

This is a very common question among us Bangladeshi students. To answer it simply, In the US (and in most other countries) pre-university level educational institutes are regarded as high schools. So for the Bangla medium, up to HSC level (class 12) is high school (though we call it college).

On a similar note, many universities for undergraduate education are called colleges. Although, there are a few differences (especially in the US).

| College | University |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Only Undergrad | Undergrad + Postgrad |
| Smaller campus + Student body | Larger campus + Student body |
| More teaching-focused | More research-focused |

Some universities have a dedicated college inside them. For example: Harvard University has Harvard College, Yale University has Yale College etc. Usually these are undergraduate branch of the university that focus more of liberal arts education. Basically you get the best of both worlds.
