# Scoir/Coalition

An alternative portal to the Common App, mostly used by students who have already filled their Common App slots. Scoir has both positive and negative sides. 

## Positive
A lot of universities on Scoir are completely free to apply to, you don't have to send a fee waiver request, or make your counselor sign a fee waiver request.

##Negative
It is a huge pain compared to the Common App, mainly because your counselor and your teacher have to upload the documents separately as opposed to the Common App where they can just upload the documents and these will automatically be added to any college you add and automatically removed from any college you remove. 
Also, you can not invite your teachers & counselors before submitting a preliminary application and you also can't write your supplementals for the college before finishing the preliminary application. You need to report all your test scores, coursework, activites, and then finally your essay. Only after that will you be able to invite your counselor, teachers, and write your supplemental essays.
