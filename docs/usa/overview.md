# Overview

The US college application process is the toughest and most overwhelming in my opinion.

USA takes pride in it's holistic application process. The 'holistic' approach simply means that [colleges/universities](/docs/usa/college-listing#colleges-vs-universities) in the US looks at multiples factors beyond just your GPA and test scores to get a complete picture of you.

Here's an overview of what they usually look at:

- **Your Brains**: GPA, Test Scores, Essays, Academic Awards etc.
- **Your Passion**: Extra-curricular activities, Hobbies, Volunteering, Non-Academic Awards, Talents etc.
- **Your Story**: Your background, family, environment, challenges you've faced, interests, goals etc.
- **Your Vibe**: How well your passion, talents, interests fit the college's culture and community.
