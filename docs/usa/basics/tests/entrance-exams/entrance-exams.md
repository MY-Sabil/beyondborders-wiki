# Entrance Exams

In recent years, many universities have made it an optional requirement to submit entrance exam results. However, for international students like us, nothing is optional. College entrance exams are mainly there to test the readiness of a student for college-level coursework. A good SAT/ACT score can be the deciding factor for your entire application. Given that these tests are readily available and fairly easy to take, it's a waste not to sit for an exam.

There are mainly two exams you can sit for:

1. [SAT](/docs/usa/basics/tests/entrance-exams/sat/)
2. [ACT](/docs/usa/basics/tests/entrance-exams/act/)
