# Myths About IELTS

## Myth 1: "IELTS dao bidesh jao"
It's not that simple, although I really wish it was. 

##Myth 2: "Speaking fast means a higher score"
Speaking speed has no direct correlation with scores. Examiners look for:
- Clear pronunciation
- Natural pace
- Appropriate pausing
- Proper stress and intonation
- Speaking too fast often leads to pronunciation errors and reduced comprehensibility.

##Myth 3: "You must use sophisticated vocabulary in every sentence"
Over-using complex vocabulary can sound unnatural and may lead to improper usage. You should focus on talking smoothly and letting your words flow out, instead of hyper focusing on using complex vocabulary which doesn't benefit your score.

##Myth 4: "Memorizing essays is the key to success"
WHAT? WHO DOES THIS?

##Myth 5: "Using long, complex sentences always improves scores"
Good writing requires:
- Mix of sentence structures
- Clear communication
- Appropriate complexity
- Logical flow
