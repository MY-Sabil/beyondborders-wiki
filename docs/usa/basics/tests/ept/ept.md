# English Proficiency Tests

English proficiency tests are standardized assessments that measure non-native English speakers' ability to understand and use English at an academic level. These tests are typically required for international students applying to colleges and universities in the United States. 

Although many universities in USA will sign an EPT waiver for English Medium & English Version students (which means they don't have to give any english profieciency test at all), it is still suggested to give one of IELTS/TOEFL because if you're going to apply to other countries, you're going to need it. 

*DET is new on the block and many universities in Europe or elsewhere don't accept it as widely as IELTS or TOEFL*
