# Academic Transcripts

An academic transcript is an official document that provides a detailed record of a student's academic performance throughout their secondary education. It serves as a standardized way for colleges to evaluate academic achievement and preparation for higher education. Transcripts are typically maintained and issued by the school's registrar or administrative office.

Transcripts consist of your mid term and final term exam results for grades 9-12.
