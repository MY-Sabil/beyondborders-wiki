# Predicted Grades

As you know already, we apply to colleges in the US before we are even done with our 12th grade exams, which means that you have to report a "predicted grade" (also known as forecast grade) which would help the admissions officer get an idea of what you are likely to score in your final exams (so for English Medium students it would be their A2 exams, while for NCTB students it will be their HSC final exams).

Predicted grades are reported by your teachers and a copy is made available for the counselor which they can then send to the universities.
