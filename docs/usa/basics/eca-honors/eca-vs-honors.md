# ECA vs Honors

Extracurriculars are activities that you do outside studying. Honors are awards that you earn throughout your 4 years of high school. 

Extracurriculars can lead to honors. For example, a person wins the Nobel prize for fixing world hunger with his organization. In this case the honor is the Nobel prize, while the extracurricular is his community service through his organization.
