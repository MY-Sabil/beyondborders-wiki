## What's in this wiki

üîç Comprehensive and up-to-date information on the whole process

üìò Guides on various standardized tests

üè´  Information about specific colleges

üó∫Ô∏è Application processes for specific countries

## How to get started

To start, click on any of the countries on the left sidebar (three dots on mobile) and dive deeper into the process of each of these countries.

## Why this was built

As future college applicants ourselves, we have noticed the lack of collected information or guidance in a single place. That is why we took in upon ourselves to build such an open platform where anyone can share the information they have on anything related to higher study abroad.

## Why the name

This wiki was inspired by the ever-helpful [Bangladeshis Beyond Borders](https://www.facebook.com/groups/BdBeyondBorder) community.

Unable to decide on a name for this wiki üòÖ, we opted for the name 'Beyond Borders' as a tribute to the BBB community. Just like how BBB community has helped us in various ways over the years, with this wiki, we intend to do the same for future scholars.
